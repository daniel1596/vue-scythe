Playing around with Vue to make a basic website


If I attempt to do a Scythe thing - this guy isn't going about his stuff the right way but he did try. https://github.com/joeforshaw/scythe

Roadmap (for Scythe):
	- Create a hex. Display it on screen.
	- Create several hexes around it.
	- Create a character or something to move.
	- Decide how the character will look (for now) and how it will be moved (for now).
	- Move an object from one hex to another.


Later:
	- Create the whole game board. 
	- Move pieces around it.
Not until this point - think about implementing other things.
